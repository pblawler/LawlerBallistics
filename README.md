This windows desktop application provides a ballistic solution for super sonic, trans sonic, and sub sonic flight.  The solution provides for custom drag and slopes in all regions.  The applicaiton also has a comprehensive reloading interface that preforms statistical analysis on load measurements, tracks lots of components and cartridges, saves load recipe information, and calculates load performance.
There are options to enter gun information with multiple barrel options for each gun.  Load recipes can be worked and associated to specific gun/barrel combinations.

The application is still in initial development and has not reached release one yet.  Upon completion of the initial requirements a mobile companion application will be developed for field use.
